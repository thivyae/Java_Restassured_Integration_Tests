         rent node called httplifecycle. You can have as many httplifecycles as you want in one configuration. Under each httplifecycle you should have one request and one response nodes. Each of the latter has its respective children nodes as per above example. Response latency is in milliseconds. Indentation of httplifecycle is not required. In other words, the following format is also valid:

httplifecycle:
request:
method: GET
url: /invoice/123
response:
status: 200
body: This is a response for 123

httplifecycle:
request:
method: POST
url: /invoice/123
postBody: post body
response:
status: 200
body: This is a response for 123
